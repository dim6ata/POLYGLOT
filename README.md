# POLYGLOT

### Portfolio Part #7: POLYGLOT is an Android translation application that allows users to manage phrases and their translations into various languages. 
###

#### POLYGLOT is my second Android Application, which has been written as a part of a university project with the purpose of producing an Android tool that utilises the IBM Watson Language Translator service (https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/language-translator). 

The application contains the following functionalities: 
1. 'Add Phrases' allows users to enter new phrases in English, which are stored in an SQLite database and can then be used for translations. 
2. 'Edit Phrases' allows users to edit existing phrases.
3. 'Display Phrases' allows users to view all phrase entries that are stored on the database. 
4. 'Subscribed Languages' allows users to view current language subscriptions, as well as update them according to their needs.
5. 'Translate' allows users to see a list of phrases, choose a language in which the translation will occur and by clicking on an individual line, the translation is automatically presented. Additionally, the users can press on the speaker icon, which converts the text to speech and plays back the sound of the translation. Further functionalities:
    * 'Translate All' stores translations of all languages for each subscribed language to the database. 
    * 'View All' presents two lists 
      - one of the orginal phrases and 
      - another of their translated counterparts. 
    
    When a line is selected in either of the TableViews the associated element is also highlighted.
